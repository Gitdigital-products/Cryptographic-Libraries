# Cryptography Library Audit Checklist

## Core Requirements
- [ ] All operations are constant-time
- [ ] No secret-dependent branches or memory accesses
- [ ] Proper input validation on all public APIs
- [ ] Secure memory zeroing for sensitive data
- [ ] Protection against timing attacks

## Algorithm-Specific Checks
### ECDSA
- [ ] RFC 6979 deterministic signatures implemented
- [ ] Replay attack protection
- [ ] Signature malleability addressed

### AES-GCM
- [ ] IV uniqueness guaranteed
- [ ] Authentication tag verification
- [ ] Maximum message length enforcement

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] 100% branch coverage
- [ ] Known-answer test vectors from standards
- [ ] Fuzzing for 24+ hours
- [ ] Power analysis simulation
